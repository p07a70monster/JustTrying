# Just a Technical Recruiter Looking To Use This to Recruit and Practice Coding
About me:
Hi I'm Josh and I recruit for IT positions in the US
I recruit for complex IT Jobs spanning Java Developers, Devops Engineer, Cloud Engineers, Arcitects, and the like
I'm using this to help find good candidates while at the same time help brush up on coding as I learn along
I hope we get along and I hope I get to work with anyone reading this soon
